## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a vision for the near future development of the pandemic in NYC to reduce uncertainty. We achieve this goal by develop time series forecasting and generating models with multiple types of time series. The final product that we produce is an automatic system which can update data, models, and predictions on daily basis.
